## Demo üé•

A messy `C` code snippet before formatting:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int add(int a, int b){
return a + b;
}
int Main(){
int MyVariable = 5;
float FloatingPointVariable = 3.14;
for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
printf("i = %d\n", i); 
if(i==5){ 
printf("i is 5\n");
}
}
if(5>10){
printf("5 is grater");
}
while(1){
printf("Infinite loop\n");
}
}
```

after pressing `Ctrl+Alt+I`:
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int Main()
{
    int MyVariable = 5;
    float FloatingPointVariable = 3.14;
    
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        printf("i = %d\n", i); 
        
        if(i==5)
        {
            printf("i is 5\n");
        }
    }
    
    if(5>10)
    {
        printf("5 is grater");
    }
    
    while(1)
    {
        printf("Infinite loop\n");
    }
}
```
